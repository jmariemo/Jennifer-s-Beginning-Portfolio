## UCB Bootcamp Module 2 Homework Challenge
Submission May 22 2023
This is my second re-submission for the UCB Bootcamp Module 4 Homework Challenge.
My most recent point deductions were provided with the following comments:
- The application's navigation doesn't include links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you. The navigation links to worked, working, to work
- The section about your work doesn't contain titled images of your applications or placeholder images with the first image being larger in size than the others

I have restructured the sections to reflect standard titles reflecting "about you", "your work", and "how to contact you".
I have included titled images of my applications with the first image being larger in size than the others.

Submission May 18 2023
This is my re-submission for the UCB Bootcamp Module 4 Homework Challenge. Phew! I am so proud of myself for dialing in my vision and figuring out the joys of flexbox. First and foremost, this submission includes a live deployed site for review. I've included a photo of myself, and my navigation links to each corresponding section when the page is in column-view out of responsiveness to a smaller viewport. However, the "Worked" navigation link sends the "Worked" section to behind the navigation bar when the page is in column-view out of responsiveness to a smaller viewport. My next steps are to resolve this bug so that the responsive view presents seamlessly.
